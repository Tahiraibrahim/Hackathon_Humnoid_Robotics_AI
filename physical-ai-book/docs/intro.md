# Welcome to Physical AI Book

**A Hands-On Guide to Physical AI & Robotics for Beginners**

## What You'll Learn

This book teaches you the fundamentals of **Physical AI** — building intelligent machines that perceive, think, and act in the real world. Through 5 progressive chapters and 15 hands-on lessons, you'll go from "What is a robot?" to building multi-robot systems that coordinate intelligently.

### Chapter Overview

- **Chapter 1: Foundations** — Understand Physical AI concepts, build your first robot simulator
- **Chapter 2: Building Your Bot** — Assemble hardware, control motors, understand actuators
- **Chapter 3: Perception** — Read sensors, understand the environment, respond intelligently
- **Chapter 4: Intelligence** — Introduce machine learning, create adaptive behaviors
- **Chapter 5: Advanced** — Multi-robot coordination, manipulation, capstone project

## How This Book Works

Each lesson follows a **hands-on learning philosophy**:

1. **Real Code First** — Every lesson includes working Python code tested on actual hardware
2. **Concepts Explained** — Understand *why* things work, not just *how*
3. **Exercise & Build** — Practice with guided exercises before taking on challenges
4. **Troubleshooting** — Learn common issues and how to solve them

## Requirements

### Time Commitment
- Each lesson: 45-60 minutes
- Full book: 12-15 hours spread over weeks or months

### Hardware (Optional)
- Budget: $40-150 per lesson for robotics kits
- Can also use simulation mode (software only)

### Software
- Python 3.9+
- Docusaurus (we provide it)
- Git for version control

## Getting Started

**Option 1: Learn with Hardware**
1. Purchase a robotics kit ($40-150)
2. Start with [Chapter 1, Lesson 1.1](/docs/chapter-foundations/lesson-intro)
3. Follow along with hands-on exercises

**Option 2: Learn with Simulation (Free)**
1. Install Python locally
2. Use our simulation tools (no hardware needed)
3. Start with [Chapter 1, Lesson 1.1](/docs/chapter-foundations/lesson-intro)

## Who This Book Is For

- **Beginners** with basic Python knowledge
- **Intermediate learners** who want to build robots
- **Educators** teaching Physical AI or robotics
- **Makers & hobbyists** interested in autonomous systems

## Our Principles

✅ **Hands-On Learning First** — Code runs before theory
✅ **Progressive Complexity** — Build skills chapter by chapter
✅ **Accessible & Inclusive** — Clear language, WCAG AA standards
